The street is located in a rural area, surrounded by fields and houses.

The yellow text on the map highlights the issue with the street, stating that it is not paved, not named, and not equipped with public lighting. The map also shows the location of several other streets and buildings in the area.

The image suggests that the municipality has not provided adequate infrastructure for the residents of this area, including proper road maintenance and lighting. This could be a significant issue for residents, particularly at night when it may be difficult to navigate the unpaved street.

The pole is situated in a field, with houses visible in the background. The sky above is overcast.

The problem with the streetlight is that it has not been working since it was installed. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as a faulty electrical connection, a broken light bulb, or a malfunctioning solar panel. The fact that the light has not been working for an extended period suggests that it may have been damaged or neglected.

This issue could disrupt residents in the area in several ways:

1. Safety: The lack of lighting at night can make it difficult for pedestrians to navigate the area, increasing the risk of accidents.
2. Aesthetics: A non-functional streetlight can be an eyesore and detract from the overall appearance of the neighborhood.
3. Property values: A well-lit area can be more attractive to potential buyers and renters, so a non-functional streetlight could negatively impact property values.
4. Crime: Poor lighting can create an environment conducive to criminal activity, as it makes it easier for perpetrators to remain anonymous.

Overall, the non-functional streetlight is a significant issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the safety, aesthetics, and property values of the area.",7,Public Lighting

The light fixture is positioned at the top of the pole and is held in place by two wires that extend from the pole to the light fixture. The light fixture is rectangular in shape and appears to be made of metal or plastic. It is not illuminated, suggesting that it is not functioning properly.

The pole supporting the light fixture is made of wood and has a rough, weathered appearance. It is likely that the pole has been exposed to the elements for an extended period, which may have contributed to the damage to the light fixture.

The wires connecting the light fixture to the pole are thin and appear to be made of metal. They are attached to the pole using small metal brackets, which are securely fastened to the pole. The wires are not damaged, but they do appear to be worn and frayed in some areas, suggesting that they may be in need of replacement.

Overall, the image suggests that the streetlight has been out of service for some time, and that the light fixture has been damaged.

In the background, there is a large building with a flat roof and a few windows. The building is illuminated by streetlights, which are casting a warm glow over the surrounding area. There are also several cranes visible in the distance, suggesting that construction or development is taking place in the area.

The overall atmosphere of the image is one of darkness and desolation, with the only light coming from the streetlights and the building. This suggests that the area may be poorly lit, which could be a concern for residents or visitors who may feel unsafe at night.

Based on the image, I would assess the severity of the problem as follows:

* The lack of public lighting on Ferid Curri Street is a significant concern, as it could pose a safety risk to residents and visitors who may need to navigate the area at night.
* The presence of construction cranes in the background suggests that the area is undergoing development, which could lead to increased traffic and pedestrian activity in the area.

**Problem Description:**
The problem reported is related to a poorly installed canalization system on Vidovdanska road in the lower part of Pristina. The canalization is leaking, causing polluted water to flow onto the road and into a pit. This issue has been ongoing and is affecting the health of the residents in the area, as they are at risk of infection.

**Impact on Residents:**
The presence of polluted water on the road and in the pit poses a significant risk to the health of the residents in the area. The water can contain harmful bacteria and other contaminants that can cause illnesses such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever. Additionally, the smell of the polluted water can be unpleasant and may also contribute to health problems.

**Severity Assessment:**
Based on the description of the problem, I would assess the severity of the issue as high. The presence of polluted water on the road and in the pit poses a significant risk to the health of the residents in the area, and the issue has been ongoing for an extended period. The fact that the canalization is poorly installed and leaking suggests that the municipality has not taken adequate measures to address the problem, which further exacerbates the severity of the issue.

**Recommendations:**
To address this issue, I recommend that the municipality takes immediate action to repair the canalization system and install a new one if necessary. Additionally, the municipality should provide alternative water sources for the residents in the area until the problem is resolved. It is also important to conduct regular inspections of the canalization system to ensure that it is functioning properly and to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

The street appears to be dimly lit, with only a few lights visible. The buildings on the left side of the street are not clearly visible due to the darkness. The sidewalk on the right side of the street is also poorly lit, making it difficult to see any details.

The presence of a yellow railing at the top of the image suggests that there may be a staircase or balcony above the street level. The brick wall on the right side of the street adds to the overall sense of darkness and neglect.

Overall, the image conveys a sense of neglect and disrepair, with poor lighting and overgrown vegetation contributing to an atmosphere of abandonment. The lack of streetlights and the presence of a yellow railing suggest that the area may not be well-maintained or safe for pedestrians.

Severity Assessment:

* **Lighting:** The street is poorly lit, which can lead to safety concerns for pedestrians and drivers.
* **Neglect:** The presence of overgrown vegetation and a yellow railing suggests that the area may not be well-maintained.
* **Safety:** The lack of streetlights and the presence of a yellow railing may indicate that the area is not safe for pedestrians.

Based on the description provided by the person who submitted the photo, it appears that the issue is with the public lighting in the alleyway. The streetlights are not functioning correctly, which is causing concerns for the safety and comfort of residents in the area.

To assess the severity of this issue, we need to consider the potential impact on residents and the community. Here are some factors to consider:

* Safety: The lack of proper lighting in the alleyway can make it difficult for people to navigate safely, especially at night. This could lead to accidents or injuries.
* Comfort: The dim lighting can also make the alleyway feel uncomfortable or even scary, which could discourage people from using the area.
* Community impact: The alleyway may be used by residents, businesses, or visitors, and the lack of proper lighting could affect their ability to use the area effectively.

Overall, the severity of this issue is moderate to high.

Based on the description provided, it appears that the resident who submitted the photo is complaining about the lack of functioning irrigation systems in the Rruga e Bëndrit area. This could potentially cause disruptions to the local community, such as:

* Overgrown vegetation: Without proper irrigation, plants and trees may grow unchecked, leading to overgrown vegetation that can obstruct sidewalks, roads, and other public spaces.
* Water scarcity: The lack of functioning irrigation systems may lead to water scarcity, affecting not only the local flora but also the residents who rely on these systems for their daily needs.
* Aesthetics: The overgrown vegetation and lack of proper maintenance may negatively impact the aesthetic appeal of the area, potentially deterring visitors and investors.

To address this issue, the municipality could consider the following steps:

* Conduct an assessment: The municipality should conduct an assessment of the irrigation systems in the Rruga e Bëndrit area to determine the extent of the problem and identify potential solutions.
* Repair or replace systems: The municipality should repair or replace the malfunctioning irrigation systems to ensure that they are functioning properly.
* Implement maintenance schedules: The municipality should implement regular maintenance schedules to prevent future malfunctions and ensure that the systems are well-maintained.
* Educate residents: The municipality should educate residents on the importance of proper irrigation management and encourage them to report any issues with the systems.

Beyond the archway, the street stretches out into the distance, lined with what appear to be streetlights. However, these lights are not very bright, casting long shadows across the pavement. The lack of illumination creates an eerie and foreboding ambiance.

The background of the image is shrouded in darkness, making it impossible to discern any details beyond the street itself. The absence of any notable features or landmarks adds to the sense of desolation and isolation.

Overall, the image conveys a sense of neglect and disrepair, with the dim lighting and deserted street suggesting a lack of investment or attention to the area. The presence of the archway and streetlights implies that there was once an effort to improve the street's appearance, but it has since fallen into disrepair.

In terms of the municipality complaint, the image suggests that the issue is related to the maintenance and upkeep of the streetlights, which are not functioning properly.

The buildings and houses along the street are mostly dark, with only a few windows illuminated by the faint light of the streetlight. The overall effect is one of darkness and isolation, which may be unsettling for residents who rely on streetlights for safety and security.

Based on this description, I would assess the severity of the problem as moderate. The lack of lighting on the street creates an unsafe environment, particularly for pedestrians and drivers who may be vulnerable to accidents or crimes. Additionally, the dim lighting may also affect the overall aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, making it less attractive to potential residents or visitors.

To address this issue, the municipality could consider installing new streetlights or upgrading existing ones to provide better illumination. They could also work with local residents to identify areas where lighting is particularly needed and prioritize those areas for improvement. By taking these steps, the municipality can help create a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone in the community.",5,Public Lighting

The photo was taken in Kosovo, and the individual who submitted it has reported the issue as an abandoned problem. The severity assessment model will likely assign a high level of severity to this issue due to the potential for accidents and the overall state of disrepair.

To quantify the severity of the problem, the model may consider factors such as:

* The location of the dumpsters: Being placed on the side of a road increases the risk of accidents and obstructs traffic flow.
* The amount of waste: The dumpsters are overflowing, indicating a significant accumulation of construction waste.
* The condition of the road: The presence of hard, asphalt-like residue suggests poor maintenance and potential hazards for drivers.
* The urgency of the situation: The individual who submitted the photo has emphasized the need for urgent intervention, highlighting the immediate danger posed by the situation.

Based on these factors, the severity assessment model may assign a score of 8 or 9 out of 10, indicating a high level of severity. This score reflects the potential for accidents, the impact on traffic flow, and the overall state of disrepair, which all contribute to a significant risk to public safety and well-being.",8,Other

The lack of public lighting in the Sofali neighborhood poses a significant risk to residents' safety and well-being. The absence of streetlights makes it difficult for people to navigate the streets, especially at night, increasing the risk of accidents and crimes.

**Severity Assessment**

The severity of this issue is high due to the potential harm it can cause to residents, particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children. The lack of public lighting can also deter businesses and investment in the area, leading to economic decline and further exacerbating the problem.

The overall atmosphere of the image suggests that it was taken during a cold winter evening.

The image highlights a problem with the public lighting in the area, as the streetlight is not functioning properly. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a power outage, maintenance issues, or damage to the light itself. The fact that the streetlight is not working could pose a safety risk to residents and pedestrians in the area, particularly at night when visibility is already limited.

The image also shows that the area is experiencing heavy snowfall, which could be contributing to the issues with the streetlight. The snow could be weighing down the light or causing it to malfunction.

Overall, the image suggests that the municipality needs to address the issue with the public lighting in the area, particularly during inclement weather conditions. This could involve repairing or replacing the streetlight, as well as ensuring that the surrounding infrastructure is maintained to prevent similar issues in the future.

**Severity Assessment:**

* **Safety Risk:** 7/10 (the lack of functioning streetlight could pose a safety risk to residents and pedestrians, particularly at night)

The scene appears to be a result of construction or demolition activities, with the materials likely originating from a nearby building site.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the debris is not just random trash but rather evidence of a more significant issue. The presence of broken bricks and tiles suggests that the materials may have been discarded carelessly, potentially posing a hazard to pedestrians or vehicles in the area.

Furthermore, the fact that the debris is concentrated in one spot implies that it may have been intentionally dumped or discarded there, rather than being the result of a natural occurrence. This could indicate a lack of proper waste management practices in the area, which could lead to further environmental concerns and health risks for residents.

Given the context of the image, it is likely that the municipality complaint is related to the improper disposal of construction waste and the potential hazards it poses to the community. The severity of the problem could be assessed based on factors such as the quantity of debris, its proximity to residential areas, and the potential impact on the environment and public health.

Overall, the image suggests that the municipality complaint is a legitimate concern that requires attention and action to address the issue of improper waste disposal and ensure the safety and well-being of residents in the area.",6,Rubbish
